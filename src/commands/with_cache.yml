  Run a set of steps with gradle dependencies cached.
  This command will first restore a cache of gradle dependencies, if one was
  saved by a previous build. The provided `steps` will then be executed, and
  if successful, then a fresh cache will be saved, if required.
  The contents of the `~/.gradle` directory is cached, which will substantially
  improve build times for projects with many dependencies.
  The cache-key is generated from any files named `build.gradle` that are
  present in the `working_directory`.
parameters:
  steps:
    type: steps
